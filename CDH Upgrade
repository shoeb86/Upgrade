***********************************************************
		CDH Upgrade (5.7 to 5.9)
***********************************************************



-----**** Before you begin ****-----

* Read CDH5 release notes (https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/release-notes/topics/rg_release_notes_cdh.html)

* Read the Cloudera Manager 5 Release Notes. (https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/release-notes/topics/rg_release_notes_cm.html)

* Ensure java 1.7 or 1.8 is installed across cluster

* Ensure that the Cloudera Manager minor version is equal to or greater than the CDH minor version

* Run the Host Inspector and fix every issue.

* If using security, run the Running the Security Inspector.

* Run hdfs fsck / and hdfs dfsadmin -report and fix every issue.
 
* Review the upgrade procedure and reserve a maintenance window with enough time allotted to perform all steps. For production clusters, Cloudera recommends allocating up to a full day maintenance window to perform the upgrade, depending on the number of hosts, the amount of experience you have with Hadoop and Linux, and the particular hardware you are using.

* To avoid a high number of alerts during the upgrade process, you can enable maintenance mode on your cluster before you start the upgrade. This stops email alerts and SNMP traps from being sent, but does not stop checks and configuration validations. Exit maintenance mode when you have finished the upgrade to reenable Cloudera Manager alerts.
